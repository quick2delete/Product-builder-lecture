## Current Plan

### Feature: Lotto Number Generator

*   **Objective:** Create a user-friendly interface to generate a set of 6 unique lottery numbers.
*   **Components:**
    *   **HTML (`index.html`):** A clean structure with a title, a button to trigger the number generation, and a dedicated area to display the results.
    *   **CSS (`style.css`):** Modern styling to ensure the application is visually appealing and responsive. This includes a centered layout, custom fonts, and a color scheme that enhances user experience.
    *   **JavaScript (`main.js`):** Logic to generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45 upon a button click and display them on the page.
*   **Design & Style:**
    *   **Layout:** Centered content for easy viewing.
    *   **Typography:** Use of "Roboto" and "Montserrat" from Google Fonts for a clean, modern look.
    *   **Color Palette:** A simple and clean palette with a primary color for the button and a neutral background.
    *   **User Experience:** A clear and intuitive interface with a single call-to-action button.
